    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=27:40:D4:06:D0:C2:A1:47:52:1D:A9:9D:00:A7:32:C8:58:00:BF:94%3Bcom.findandgoapp.activity

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using this line:
    27:40:D4:06:D0:C2:A1:47:52:1D:A9:9D:00:A7:32:C8:58:00:BF:94;com.findandgoapp.activity

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
